# Layout Fix TODO

## Tasks
- [x] Refactor app/(main)/(tabs)/_layout.js to return array of <Tabs.Screen> instead of JSX fragment
- [x] Update screen names to correct relative paths (e.g., "../jobseeker/dashboard")
- [x] Check and create missing screen files (e.g., messages.js)
- [ ] Test the layout to ensure warning is resolved

## Progress
- Completed: Refactoring _layout.js, updating names, and creating messages.js
- Next: Test the layout
